The result calculated by Python for sin$\\pi$ has an order $10^{-16}$ — it is a very small number, close to zero. Why not a \"real\" zero? All calculations in real numbers are done by a computer with some limited accuracy, so often instead of \"honest\" answers, such close associates. You have to be ready for this."

And, of course, in practice we won't manually execute one code many times — there are *loops* for this. But we will get to know them at the next lecture."
